            "through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me\n",
            "at all.  But, after some difficulty having opened his bag,\n",
            "he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort\n",
            "of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.\n",
            "Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room,\n",
            "he then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--\n",

            "There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at least--\n",
            "nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald\n",
            "purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\n",

damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouse and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypo get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people hat offthen i account it high time to get to sea a soon a i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throw himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feeling towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharf a indian isle by coral reefscommerce surround it with her surf right and left the street take you waterward it extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by wave and cooled by breeze which a few hour previous were out of sight of land look at the crowd of watergazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you seeposted like silent sentinel all around the town stand thousand upon thousand of mortal men fixed in ocean revery some leaning against the spile some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwark glass of ship from china some high aloft in the rigging a if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsman of week day pent up in lath and plaster tied to counter nailed to bench clinched to desk how then is this are the green field gone what do they here but look here come more crowd pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouse will not suffice no they must get just a nigh the water a they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of themleagues inlanders all they come from lane and alley street and avenue north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me doe the magnetic virtue of the needle of the compass of all those ship attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lake take almost any path you please and ten to one it carry you down in a dale and leaf you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesstand that man on his leg set his foot agoing and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes a every one know meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desire to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employ there stand his tree each with a hollow trunk a if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleep his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage go a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodland wind a mazy way reaching to overlapping spur of mountain bathed in their hillside blue but though the picture lie thus tranced and though this pinetree shake down it sigh like leaf upon this shepherd head yet all were vain unless the shepherd eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairie in june when for score on score of mile you wade kneedeep among tigerlilieswhat is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand mile to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handful of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage a a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persian hold the sea holy why did the greek give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and wa drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all river and ocean it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eye and begin to be over conscious of my lung i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea a a passenger for to go a a passenger you must need have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passenger get seasick grow quarrelsomedo not sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much a a general thingno i never go a a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea a a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such office to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toil trial and tribulation of every kind whatsoever it is quite a much a i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ship barque brig schooner and what not and a for going a cookthough i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptian upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummy of those creature in their huge bakehouse the pyramid no when i go to sea i go a a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touch one sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it a a country schoolmaster making the tallest boy stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoic to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wear off in time what of it if some old hunk of a seacaptain order me to get a broom and sweep down the deck what doe that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scale of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel think anything the le of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunk in that particular instance who are not a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hand should rub each others shoulderblades and be content again i always go to sea a a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passenger a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passenger themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thief entailed upon u but being paid what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ill and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea a a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for a in this world head wind are far more prevalent than wind from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck get his atmosphere at second hand from the sailor on the forecastle he think he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leader in many other thing at the same time that the leader little suspect it but wherefore it wa that after having repeatedly smelt the sea a a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fate who ha the constant surveillance of me and secretly dog me and influence me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that wa drawn up a long time ago it came in a a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performance i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united state whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i can not tell why it wa exactly that those stage manager the fate put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent part in high tragedy and short and easy part in genteel comedy and jolly part in farce though i can not tell why this wa exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstance i think i can see a little into the spring and motif which being cunningly presented to me under various disguise induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it wa a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motif wa the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant sea where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless peril of the whale these with all the attending marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such thing would not have been inducement but a for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for thing remote i love to sail forbidden sea and land on barbarous coast not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it is but well to be on friendly term with all the inmate of the place one lodge in by reason of these thing then the whaling voyage wa welcome the great floodgate of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceit that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless procession of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpetbag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it wa on a saturday night in december much wa i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday a most young candidate for the pain and penalty of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may a well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind wa made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there wa a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford ha of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket wa her great original the tyre of this carthagethe place where the first dead american whale wa stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoe to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso go the story to throw at the whale in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i wa to eat and sleep meanwhile it wa a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnel i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few piece of silverso wherever you go ishmael said i to myself a i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and do not be too particular with halting step i paced the street and passed the sign of the crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red window of the swordfish inn there came such fervent ray that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inch thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projection because from hard remorseless service the sol of my boot were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sound of the tinkling glass within but go on ishmael said i at last do not you hear get away from before the door your patched boot are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the street that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inn such dreary street block of blackness not house on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look a if it were meant for the us of the public so entering the first thing i did wa to stumble over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha a the flying particle almost choked me are these ash from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoon and the the swordfishthis then must need be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black face turned round in their row to peer and beyond a black angel of doom wa beating a book in a pulpit it wa a negro church and the preacher text wa about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the dock and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these word underneaththe spouter innpeter coffin coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there a the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked a if it might have been carted here from the ruin of some burnt district and a the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here wa the very spot for cheap lodging and the best of pea coffee it wa a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied a it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his foot on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon say an old writerof whose work i posse the only copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both side and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i a this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eye are window and this body of mine is the house what a pity they did not stop up the chink and the cranny though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it is too late to make any improvement now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chip were carted off a million year ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatter with his shivering he might plug up both ear with rag and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon say old dive in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitter what northern light let them talk of their oriental summer clime of everlasting conservatory give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coal but what think lazarus can he warm his blue hand by holding them up to the grand northern light would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye god go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dive this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dive himself he too life like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sigh and being a president of a temperance society he only drink the tepid tear of orphan but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let u scrape the ice from our frosted foot and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter 3 the spouterinn entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscot reminding one of the bulwark of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it wa only by diligent study and a series of systematic visit to it and careful inquiry of the neighbor that you could any way arrive at an understanding of it purpose such unaccountable mass of shade and shadow that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hag had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you wa a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular line floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet wa there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but ala deceptive idea would dart you through it is the black sea in a midnight galeit is the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsit is a blasted heath it is a hyperborean winter sceneit is the breakingup of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancy yielded to that one portentous something in the picture midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop doe it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artist design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinion of many aged person with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with it three dismantled mast alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three masthead the opposite wall of this entry wa hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous club and spear some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saw others were tufted with knot of human hair and one wa sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you shuddered a you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lance and harpoon all broken and deformed some were storied weapon with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty year ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale year afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty foot and at last wa found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched way cut through what in old time must have been a great central chimney with fireplace all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled plank beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass case filled with dusty rarity gathered from this wide world remotest nook projecting from the further angle of the room stand a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whale head be that how it may there stand the vast arched bone of the whale jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelf ranged round with old decanter bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustle a little withered old man who for their money dearly sell the sailor delirium and death abominable are the tumbler into which he pours his poison though true cylinder withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glass deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridian rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpad goblet fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seaman gathered about a table examining by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house wa full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objection to sharing a harpooneer blanket have ye i spose you are going awhalin so you would better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer wa not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man blanket i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper supperll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar wa still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his leg he wa trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he did not make much headway i thought at last some four or five of u were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it wa cold a iceland no fire at allthe landlord said he could not afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candle each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jacket and hold to our lip cup of scalding tea with our half frozen finger but the fare wa of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potato but dumpling good heaven dumpling for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumpling in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you will have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that are not the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumpling he do not he eats nothing but steak and he like them rare the devil he doe say i where is that harpooneer is he here he will be here afore long wa the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening a a looker on presently a rioting noise wa heard without starting up the landlord cried that is the grampus crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three year voyage and a full ship hurrah boy now we will have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boot wa heard in the entry the door wa flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariner enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coat and with their head muffled in woollen comforter all bedarned and ragged and their beard stiff with icicle they seemed an eruption of bear from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this wa the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale mouth the barwhen the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore wa a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland the liquor soon mounted into their head a it generally doe even with the arrantest toper newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmate by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making a much noise a the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far a this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six foot in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a cofferdam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face wa deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadow of his eye floated some reminiscence that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he wa a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companion had mounted to it height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minute however he wa missed by his shipmate and being it seems for some reason a huge favorite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where is bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it wa now about nine of the clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgy i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i do not know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it come to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objection indefinitely multiply nor wa there any earthly reason why i a a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it wa fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen a the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it wa getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i have changed my mind about that harpooneer i shall not sleep with him i will try the bench here just a you please i am sorry i can not spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it is a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knot and notch but wait a bit skrimshander i have got a carpenter plane there in the barwait i say and i will make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shaving flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord wa near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven sake to quitthe bed wa soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shaving with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it wa a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it wa a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room wa about four inch higher than the planed one so there wa no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially a another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwind in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop could not i steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knocking it seemed no bad idea but upon second thought i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon a i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking around me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudice against this unknown harpooneer think i i will wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i will have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellow after allthere is no telling but though the other boarder kept coming in by one two and three and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such late hour it wa now hard upon twelve of the clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he is an early birdairley to bed and airley to riseyea he is the bird what catch the worm but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i do not see what on airth keep him so late unless may be he can not sell his head can not sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that is precisely it said the landlord and i told him he could not sell it here the market overstocked with what shouted i with head to be sure are not there too many head in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you would better stop spinning that yarn to mei am not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you will be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head i will break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord it is broke aready said he broke said ibroke do you mean sartain and that is the very reason he can not sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him a cool a mt hecla in a snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating story tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good a to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i have no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that is a purty long sarmon for a chap that rip a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of ha just arrived from the south sea where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand head great curio you know and he is sold all on them but one and that one he is trying to sell tonight because tomorrow sunday and it would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is going to church he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just a he wa going out of the door with four head strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inion this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business a selling the head of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pay reglar wa the rejoinder but come it is getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukesit is a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there is plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it is an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm after that sal said it would not do come along here i will give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it is sundayyou will not see that harpooneer tonight he is come to anchor somewherecome along then do come will not ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stair we went and i wa ushered into a small room cold a a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty a a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four wall and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of thing not properly belonging to the room there wa a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman bag containing the harpooneer wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there wa a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edge with little tinkling tag something like the stained porcupine quill round an indian moccasin there wa a hole or slit in the middle of this mat a you see the same in south american poncho but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the street of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp a though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeve but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed a i wa and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloon and boot and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress wa stuffed with corncob or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me think i that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cord of the large bag i before spoke of a being in the room i wa all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag mouth this accomplished however he turned roundwhen good heaven what a sight such a face it wa of a dark purplish yellow color here and there stuck over with large blackish looking square yes it is just a i thought he is a terrible bedfellow he is been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black square on his cheek they were stain of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white mana whaleman too who falling among the cannibal had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyage must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it is only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the square of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south sea and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effect upon the skin now while all these idea were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there wa no hair on his headnone to speak of at least nothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even a it wa i thought something of slipping out of the window but it wa the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i wa now a much afraid of him a if it wa the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i wa so afraid of him that i wa not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arm a i live these covered part of him were checkered with the same square a his face his back too wa all over the same dark square he seemed to have been in a thirty year war and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very leg were marked a if a parcel of dark green frog were running up the trunk of young palm it wa now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south sea and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of head tooperhaps the head of his own brother he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk but there wa no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pocket and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on it back and exactly the color of a three day old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin wa a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it wa not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage go up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard set up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andiron the chimney jamb and all the brick inside were very sooty so that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eye hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantimeto see what wa next to follow first he take about a double handful of shaving out of his grego pocket and place them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shaving into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatch into the fire and still hastier withdrawal of his finger whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ash a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lip all these strange antic were accompanied by still stranger guttural noise from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket a carelessly a if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceeding increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptom of concluding his business operation and jumping into bed with me i thought it wa high time now or never before the light wa put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say wa a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment the light wa extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural response satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angel save me speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ash about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him do not be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here would not harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why did not you tell me that that infernal harpooneer wa a cannibal i thought ye knowd itdid not i tell ye he wa a peddlin head around townbut turn fluke again and go to sleep queequeg look hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he wa on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what is all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myselfthe man a human being just a i am he ha just a much reason to fear me a i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i do not fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it is dangerous besides i are not insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side a much a to say i will not touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter 4 the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane wa of patchwork full of odd little particolored square and triangle and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two part of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeve irregularly rolled up at various time this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it a the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hue together and it wa only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg wa hugging me my sensation were strange let me try to explain them when i wa a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it wa a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance wa this i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it wa trying to crawl up the chimney a i had seen a little sweep do a few day previous and my stepmother who somehow or other wa all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the leg out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it wa only two of the clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there wa no help for it so up stair i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself a slowly a possible so a to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheet i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hour must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hour in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it wa so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coach in the street and the sound of gay voice all over the house i felt worse and worse at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged foot sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her foot beseeching her a a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she wa the best and most conscientious of stepmother and back i had to go to my room for several hour i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortune at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eye and the before sunlit room wa now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing wa to be seen and nothing wa to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside for what seemed age piled on age i lay there frozen with the most awful fear not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for day and week and month afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempt to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensation at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night event soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping a he wa he still hugged me tightly a though naught but death should part u twain i now strove to rouse himqueequegbut his only answer wa a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling a if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage side a if it were a hatchetfaced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff a a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eye a if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgiving now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became a it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself think i queequeg under the circumstance this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i wa guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motion for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you do not see every day he and his way were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenstill minus his trowsers he hunted up his boot what under the heaven he did it for i can not tell but his next movement wa to crush himself boot in hand and hat onunder the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and straining i inferred he wa hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boot but queequeg do you see wa a creature in the transition state neither caterpillar nor butterfly he wa just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education wa not yet completed he wa an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boot at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eye and began creaking and limping about the room a if not being much accustomed to boot his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide one probably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtain to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boot on i begged him a well a i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloon a soon a possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablution to his chest arm and hand he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i wa watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he take the harpoon from the bed corner slip out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begin a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheek think i queequeg this is using rogers best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the le at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edge are always kept the rest of his toilet wa soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal baton chapter 5 breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and to be spent in that way and the man that ha anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the barroom wa now full of the boarder who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not a yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mate and second mate and third mate and sea carpenter and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and harpooneer and ship keeper a brown and brawny company with bosky beard an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jacket for morning gown you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost a musky he can not have been three day landed from his indian voyage that man next him look a few shade lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless ha tarried whole week ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tint seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climate zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dog a ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which wa the sum of poor mungos performance this kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflection just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i wa preparing to hear some good story about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whale on the high seasentire stranger to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round a sheepishly at each other a though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountain a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whalemen but a for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced a cool a an icicle to be sure i can not say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many head and grappling the beefsteak towards him but that wa certainly very coolly done by him and every one know that in most people estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarity here how he eschewed coffee and hot roll and applied his undivided attention to beefsteak done rare enough that when breakfast wa over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and wa sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter 6 the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual a queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescript from foreign part even in broadway and chestnut street mediterranean mariner will sometimes jostle the affrighted lady regent street is not unknown to lascar and malay and at bombay in the apollo green live yankee have often scared the native but new bedford beat all water street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunt you see only sailor but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chatting at street corner savage outright many of whom yet carry on their bone unholy flesh it make a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the street you will see other sight still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town score of green vermonter and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frame fellow who have felled forest and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance many are a green a the green mountain whence they came in some thing you would think them but a few hour old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wear a beaver hat and swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and a sheathknife here come another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tanning his hand now when a country dandy like this take it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and join the great whalefishery you should see the comical thing he doe upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his seaoutfit he order bellbuttons to his waistcoat strap to his canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those strap in the first howling gale when thou art driven strap button and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town ha only harpooneer cannibal and bumpkin to show her visitor not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for u whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in a howling condition a the coast of labrador a it is part of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the street do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh egg yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patricianlike house park and garden more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoon round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave house and flowery garden came from the atlantic pacific and indian ocean one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford father they say give whale for dower to their daughter and portion off their niece with a few porpoise apiece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoir of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their length in spermaceti candle in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maple long avenue of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their tapering upright cone of congregated blossom so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford ha superinduced bright terrace of flower upon the barren refuse rock thrown aside at creation final day and the woman of new bedford they bloom like their own red rose but rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheek is perennial a sunlight in the seventh heaven elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye can not save in salem where they tell me the young girl breathe such musk their sailor sweetheart smell them mile off shore a though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sand\n"

thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouse and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypo get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people hat offthen i account it high time to get to sea a soon a i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throw himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feeling towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharf a indian isle by coral reefscommerce surround it with her surf right and left the street take you waterward it extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by wave and cooled by breeze which a few hour previous were out of sight of land look at the crowd of watergazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you seeposted like silent sentinel all around the town stand thousand upon thousand of mortal men fixed in ocean revery some leaning against the spile some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwark glass of ship from china some high aloft in the rigging a if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsman of week day pent up in lath and plaster tied to counter nailed to bench clinched to desk how then is this are the green field gone what do they here but look here come more crowd pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouse will not suffice no they must get just a nigh the water a they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of themleagues inlanders all they come from lane and alley street and avenue north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me doe the magnetic virtue of the needle of the compass of all those ship attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lake take almost any path you please and ten to one it carry you down in a dale and leaf you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesstand that man on his leg set his foot agoing and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes a every one know meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desire to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employ there stand his tree each with a hollow trunk a if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleep his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage go a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodland wind a mazy way reaching to overlapping spur of mountain bathed in their hillside blue but though the picture lie thus tranced and though this pinetree shake down it sigh like leaf upon this shepherd head yet all were vain unless the shepherd eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairie in june when for score on score of mile you wade kneedeep among tigerlilieswhat is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand mile to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handful of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage a a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persian hold the sea holy why did the greek give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and wa drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all river and ocean it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eye and begin to be over conscious of my lung i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea a a passenger for to go a a passenger you must need have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passenger get seasick grow quarrelsomedo not sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much a a general thingno i never go a a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea a a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such office to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toil trial and tribulation of every kind whatsoever it is quite a much a i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ship barque brig schooner and what not and a for going a cookthough i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptian upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummy of those creature in their huge bakehouse the pyramid no when i go to sea i go a a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touch one sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it a a country schoolmaster making the tallest boy stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoic to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wear off in time what of it if some old hunk of a seacaptain order me to get a broom and sweep down the deck what doe that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scale of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel think anything the le of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunk in that particular instance who are not a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hand should rub each others shoulderblades and be content again i always go to sea a a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passenger a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passenger themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thief entailed upon u but being paid what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ill and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea a a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for a in this world head wind are far more prevalent than wind from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck get his atmosphere at second hand from the sailor on the forecastle he think he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leader in many other thing at the same time that the leader little suspect it but wherefore it wa that after having repeatedly smelt the sea a a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fate who ha the constant surveillance of me and secretly dog me and influence me in some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that wa drawn up a long time ago it came in a a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performance i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united state whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i can not tell why it wa exactly that those stage manager the fate put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent part in high tragedy and short and easy part in genteel comedy and jolly part in farce though i can not tell why this wa exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstance i think i can see a little into the spring and motif which being cunningly presented to me under various disguise induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it wa a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motif wa the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant sea where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless peril of the whale these with all the attending marvel of a thousand patagonian sight and sound helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such thing would not have been inducement but a for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for thing remote i love to sail forbidden sea and land on barbarous coast not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it is but well to be on friendly term with all the inmate of the place one lodge in by reason of these thing then the whaling voyage wa welcome the great floodgate of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceit that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless procession of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpetbag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it wa on a saturday night in december much wa i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday a most young candidate for the pain and penalty of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may a well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind wa made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there wa a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford ha of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket wa her great original the tyre of this carthagethe place where the first dead american whale wa stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoe to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso go the story to throw at the whale in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i wa to eat and sleep meanwhile it wa a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnel i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few piece of silverso wherever you go ishmael said i to myself a i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and do not be too particular with halting step i paced the street and passed the sign of the crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red window of the swordfish inn there came such fervent ray that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inch thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projection because from hard remorseless service the sol of my boot were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sound of the tinkling glass within but go on ishmael said i at last do not you hear get away from before the door your patched boot are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the street that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inn such dreary street block of blackness not house on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look a if it were meant for the us of the public so entering the first thing i did wa to stumble over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha a the flying particle almost choked me are these ash from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoon and the the swordfishthis then must need be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black face turned round in their row to peer and beyond a black angel of doom wa beating a book in a pulpit it wa a negro church and the preacher text wa about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the dock and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these word underneaththe spouter innpeter coffin coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there a the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked a if it might have been carted here from the ruin of some burnt district and a the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here wa the very spot for cheap lodging and the best of pea coffee it wa a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied a it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor paul tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his foot on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon say an old writerof whose work i posse the only copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both side and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i a this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eye are window and this body of mine is the house what a pity they did not stop up the chink and the cranny though and thrust in a little lint here and there but it is too late to make any improvement now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chip were carted off a million year ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatter with his shivering he might plug up both ear with rag and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon say old dive in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitter what northern light let them talk of their oriental summer clime of everlasting conservatory give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coal but what think lazarus can he warm his blue hand by holding them up to the grand northern light would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye god go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dive this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dive himself he too life like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sigh and being a president of a temperance society he only drink the tepid tear of orphan but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let u scrape the ice from our frosted foot and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter 3 the spouterinn entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscot reminding one of the bulwark of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it wa only by diligent study and a series of systematic visit to it and careful inquiry of the neighbor that you could any way arrive at an understanding of it purpose such unaccountable mass of shade and shadow that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hag had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you wa a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular line floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet wa there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but ala deceptive idea would dart you through it is the black sea in a midnight galeit is the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsit is a blasted heath it is a hyperborean winter sceneit is the breakingup of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancy yielded to that one portentous something in the picture midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop doe it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artist design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinion of many aged person with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with it three dismantled mast alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three masthead the opposite wall of this entry wa hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous club and spear some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saw others were tufted with knot of human hair and one wa sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you shuddered a you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lance and harpoon all broken and deformed some were storied weapon with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty year ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale year afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty foot and at last wa found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched way cut through what in old time must have been a great central chimney with fireplace all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled plank beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass case filled with dusty rarity gathered from this wide world remotest nook projecting from the further angle of the room stand a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whale head be that how it may there stand the vast arched bone of the whale jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelf ranged round with old decanter bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustle a little withered old man who for their money dearly sell the sailor delirium and death abominable are the tumbler into which he pours his poison though true cylinder withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glass deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridian rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpad goblet fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seaman gathered about a table examining by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house wa full not a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objection to sharing a harpooneer blanket have ye i spose you are going awhalin so you would better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer wa not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent man blanket i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper supperll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar wa still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his leg he wa trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he did not make much headway i thought at last some four or five of u were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it wa cold a iceland no fire at allthe landlord said he could not afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candle each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jacket and hold to our lip cup of scalding tea with our half frozen finger but the fare wa of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potato but dumpling good heaven dumpling for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumpling in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord you will have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that are not the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumpling he do not he eats nothing but steak and he like them rare the devil he doe say i where is that harpooneer is he here he will be here afore long wa the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening a a looker on presently a rioting noise wa heard without starting up the landlord cried that is the grampus crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three year voyage and a full ship hurrah boy now we will have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boot wa heard in the entry the door wa flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariner enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coat and with their head muffled in woollen comforter all bedarned and ragged and their beard stiff with icicle they seemed an eruption of bear from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this wa the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale mouth the barwhen the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore wa a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland the liquor soon mounted into their head a it generally doe even with the arrantest toper newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmate by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making a much noise a the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner one so far a this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six foot in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a cofferdam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face wa deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadow of his eye floated some reminiscence that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he wa a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companion had mounted to it height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minute however he wa missed by his shipmate and being it seems for some reason a huge favorite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington where is bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it wa now about nine of the clock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgy i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i do not know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it come to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objection indefinitely multiply nor wa there any earthly reason why i a a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it wa fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen a the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it wa getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord i have changed my mind about that harpooneer i shall not sleep with him i will try the bench here just a you please i am sorry i can not spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and it is a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knot and notch but wait a bit skrimshander i have got a carpenter plane there in the barwait i say and i will make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shaving flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord wa near spraining his wrist and i told him for heaven sake to quitthe bed wa soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shaving with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it wa a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it wa a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room wa about four inch higher than the planed one so there wa no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially a another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwind in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop could not i steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knocking it seemed no bad idea but upon second thought i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon a i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking around me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudice against this unknown harpooneer think i i will wait awhile he must be dropping in before long i will have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellow after allthere is no telling but though the other boarder kept coming in by one two and three and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such late hour it wa now hard upon twelve of the clock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally he is an early birdairley to bed and airley to riseyea he is the bird what catch the worm but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i do not see what on airth keep him so late unless may be he can not sell his head can not sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town that is precisely it said the landlord and i told him he could not sell it here the market overstocked with what shouted i with head to be sure are not there too many head in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly you would better stop spinning that yarn to mei am not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you will be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head i will break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord it is broke aready said he broke said ibroke do you mean sartain and that is the very reason he can not sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him a cool a mt hecla in a snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating story tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good a to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and i have no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath that is a purty long sarmon for a chap that rip a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of ha just arrived from the south sea where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand head great curio you know and he is sold all on them but one and that one he is trying to sell tonight because tomorrow sunday and it would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is going to church he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just a he wa going out of the door with four head strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inion this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business a selling the head of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pay reglar wa the rejoinder but come it is getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukesit is a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced there is plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed it is an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm after that sal said it would not do come along here i will give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum it is sundayyou will not see that harpooneer tonight he is come to anchor somewherecome along then do come will not ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stair we went and i wa ushered into a small room cold a a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty a a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four wall and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of thing not properly belonging to the room there wa a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seaman bag containing the harpooneer wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there wa a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edge with little tinkling tag something like the stained porcupine quill round an indian moccasin there wa a hole or slit in the middle of this mat a you see the same in south american poncho but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the street of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp a though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeve but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed a i wa and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloon and boot and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress wa stuffed with corncob or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me think i that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cord of the large bag i before spoke of a being in the room i wa all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag mouth this accomplished however he turned roundwhen good heaven what a sight such a face it wa of a dark purplish yellow color here and there stuck over with large blackish looking square yes it is just a i thought he is a terrible bedfellow he is been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black square on his cheek they were stain of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white mana whaleman too who falling among the cannibal had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyage must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all it is only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the square of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot sun tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south sea and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effect upon the skin now while all these idea were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastly thing enough and crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hat a new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there wa no hair on his headnone to speak of at least nothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even a it wa i thought something of slipping out of the window but it wa the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i wa now a much afraid of him a if it wa the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i wa so afraid of him that i wa not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arm a i live these covered part of him were checkered with the same square a his face his back too wa all over the same dark square he seemed to have been in a thirty year war and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very leg were marked a if a parcel of dark green frog were running up the trunk of young palm it wa now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south sea and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of head tooperhaps the head of his own brother he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk but there wa no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pocket and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on it back and exactly the color of a three day old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin wa a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it wa not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage go up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard set up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andiron the chimney jamb and all the brick inside were very sooty so that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eye hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantimeto see what wa next to follow first he take about a double handful of shaving out of his grego pocket and place them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shaving into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatch into the fire and still hastier withdrawal of his finger whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ash a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lip all these strange antic were accompanied by still stranger guttural noise from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket a carelessly a if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceeding increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptom of concluding his business operation and jumping into bed with me i thought it wa high time now or never before the light wa put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say wa a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great cloud of tobacco smoke the next moment the light wa extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural response satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for god sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angel save me speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ash about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him do not be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here would not harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why did not you tell me that that infernal harpooneer wa a cannibal i thought ye knowd itdid not i tell ye he wa a peddlin head around townbut turn fluke again and go to sleep queequeg look hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he wa on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal what is all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myselfthe man a human being just a i am he ha just a much reason to fear me a i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i do not fancy having a man smoking in bed with me it is dangerous besides i are not insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side a much a to say i will not touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter 4 the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane wa of patchwork full of odd little particolored square and triangle and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two part of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeve irregularly rolled up at various time this same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it a the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hue together and it wa only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg wa hugging me my sensation were strange let me try to explain them when i wa a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it wa a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance wa this i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it wa trying to crawl up the chimney a i had seen a little sweep do a few day previous and my stepmother who somehow or other wa all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the leg out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it wa only two of the clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there wa no help for it so up stair i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself a slowly a possible so a to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheet i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hour must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hour in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it wa so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coach in the street and the sound of gay voice all over the house i felt worse and worse at last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged foot sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her foot beseeching her a a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she wa the best and most conscientious of stepmother and back i had to go to my room for several hour i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortune at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eye and the before sunlit room wa now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing wa to be seen and nothing wa to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside for what seemed age piled on age i lay there frozen with the most awful fear not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for day and week and month afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempt to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensation at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past night event soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping a he wa he still hugged me tightly a though naught but death should part u twain i now strove to rouse himqueequegbut his only answer wa a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling a if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage side a if it were a hatchetfaced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff a a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eye a if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgiving now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became a it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself think i queequeg under the circumstance this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i wa guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motion for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you do not see every day he and his way were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenstill minus his trowsers he hunted up his boot what under the heaven he did it for i can not tell but his next movement wa to crush himself boot in hand and hat onunder the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and straining i inferred he wa hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boot but queequeg do you see wa a creature in the transition state neither caterpillar nor butterfly he wa just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner his education wa not yet completed he wa an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boot at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eye and began creaking and limping about the room a if not being much accustomed to boot his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide one probably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtain to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boot on i begged him a well a i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloon a soon a possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablution to his chest arm and hand he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i wa watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he take the harpoon from the bed corner slip out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begin a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheek think i queequeg this is using rogers best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the le at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edge are always kept the rest of his toilet wa soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshal baton chapter 5 breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and to be spent in that way and the man that ha anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the barroom wa now full of the boarder who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not a yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mate and second mate and third mate and sea carpenter and sea cooper and sea blacksmith and harpooneer and ship keeper a brown and brawny company with bosky beard an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jacket for morning gown you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellow healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost a musky he can not have been three day landed from his indian voyage that man next him look a few shade lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless ha tarried whole week ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tint seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climate zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dog a ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which wa the sum of poor mungos performance this kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflection just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i wa preparing to hear some good story about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whale on the high seasentire stranger to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round a sheepishly at each other a though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountain a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whalemen but a for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced a cool a an icicle to be sure i can not say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many head and grappling the beefsteak towards him but that wa certainly very coolly done by him and every one know that in most people estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarity here how he eschewed coffee and hot roll and applied his undivided attention to beefsteak done rare enough that when breakfast wa over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and wa sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter 6 the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual a queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescript from foreign part even in broadway and chestnut street mediterranean mariner will sometimes jostle the affrighted lady regent street is not unknown to lascar and malay and at bombay in the apollo green live yankee have often scared the native but new bedford beat all water street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunt you see only sailor but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chatting at street corner savage outright many of whom yet carry on their bone unholy flesh it make a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the street you will see other sight still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town score of green vermonter and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frame fellow who have felled forest and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance many are a green a the green mountain whence they came in some thing you would think them but a few hour old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wear a beaver hat and swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and a sheathknife here come another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tanning his hand now when a country dandy like this take it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and join the great whalefishery you should see the comical thing he doe upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his seaoutfit he order bellbuttons to his waistcoat strap to his canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those strap in the first howling gale when thou art driven strap button and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town ha only harpooneer cannibal and bumpkin to show her visitor not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for u whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in a howling condition a the coast of labrador a it is part of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn

brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoir of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their length in spermaceti candle in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maple long avenue of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their tapering upright cone of congregated blossom so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford ha superinduced bright terrace of flower upon the barren refuse rock thrown aside at creation final day and the woman of new bedford they bloom like their own red rose but rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheek is perennial a sunlight in the seventh heaven elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye can not save in salem
